<b>Exercise 1: Rewrite your average score computation to give English 1.5 times for scores above 80.</b>

    Enter English Score: 95
    Enter Math Score: 85
    Total Score: (95 - 80) * 1.5 + 80 + 85 = 
    Weighted Average Score: 93.75


<b>Exercise 2: Rewrite your weighted average computation program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:</b>

    Enter English Score: 95
    Enter Math Score: Eighty-Five
    Error, please enter numeric input
    Enter English Score: Ninety
    Error, please enter numeric input

<b>Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:</b>

     Score   Grade
    >= 0.9     A
    >= 0.8     B
    >= 0.7     C
    >= 0.6     D
     < 0.6     F
    Enter score: 0.95
    A
    Enter score: perfect
    Bad score
    Enter score: 10.0
    Bad score
    Enter score: 0.75
    C
    Enter score: 0.5
    F
Run the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various different values for input.
